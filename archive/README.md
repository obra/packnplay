This directory contains historical documentation that was used during packnplay development but is no longer needed for current users or maintainers.

## Contents

### Implementation Plans
- `2025-10-23-cage-implementation.md` - Original cage/packnplay implementation plan (superseded by actual implementation)
- `2025-11-10-devcontainer-mounts-runargs-implementation.md` - Implementation plan for mounts/runArgs features (completed)

### Design Documents
- `2025-10-23-cage-sandbox-design.md` - Original design document (superseded by implementation)

## Why Archived

These documents served their purpose during development but are no longer relevant:
- Implementation plans: The features have been implemented and committed to the codebase
- Design documents: The actual implementation may differ from original designs
- Research documents: Analysis was used for planning but is now superseded by user guides

## For Historical Reference

If you need to understand why certain architectural decisions were made or how features were originally planned, these documents provide that historical context.
